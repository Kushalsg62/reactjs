# REACT MINI PROJECTS COLLECTION

A curated assemblage of compact React applications built during my learning trajectory. Each project is a focused exercise that demonstrates practical application of core React concepts and incremental maturation in engineering judgment.

## WHAT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS

- Independent mini applications, each located in its own directory
- Concise, idiomatic JavaScript and component-driven structure
- Practical usage of essential React constructs:
  - Component-based design and composition
  - Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
  - Conditional and dynamic rendering
  - Controlled forms and validation patterns
  - List rendering with keys and iterative UI construction
  - Lightweight state-management techniques

## INTENT / VALUE PROPOSITION

This repository functions as both a learning ledger and a professional artefact. It exhibits progressive skill acquisition, pragmatic problem solving, and attention to maintainability. The set is suitable for portfolio review by recruiters, collaborators or peers wishing to appraise coding style and UI reasoning.

## HOW TO RUN A PROJECT

1. Open the folder of the project you want to run
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
   npm start
```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser (unless the project specifies another port)

## PROJECTS (PLACEHOLDER — REPLACE WITH YOUR LIST)

- **Password Manager** — a small CRUD app demonstrating controlled inputs and local persistence
- **Digital Timer** — timer logic, intervals and UI state transitions
- **Money Manager** — transaction CRUD, aggregation and list rendering
- **Bike Rental Dashboard** — (example) integrates tables, forms and DB mock
- …add your projects here (each item: name — one-line description)

## TECHNOLOGIES

- React (functional components + hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid)
- Optional: localStorage, context API, or small libraries depending on project
