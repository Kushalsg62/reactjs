#REACT MINI PROJECTS COLLECTION

A curated assemblage of compact React applications built during my learning trajectory. Each project is a focused exercise that demonstrates practical application of core React concepts and incremental maturation in engineering judgment.

#WHAT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS

Independent mini applications, each located in its own directory.

Concise, idiomatic JavaScript and component-driven structure.

Practical usage of essential React constructs:

Component-based design and composition

Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)

Conditional and dynamic rendering

Controlled forms and validation patterns

List rendering with keys and iterative UI construction

Lightweight state-management techniques

INTENT / VALUE PROPOSITION

This repository functions as both a learning ledger and a professional artefact. It exhibits progressive skill acquisition, pragmatic problem solving, and attention to maintainability. The set is suitable for portfolio review by recruiters, collaborators or peers wishing to appraise coding style and UI reasoning.

CONTRIBUTION & NOTES

This collection is primarily a personal learning archive. Pull requests are welcome if you propose substantive improvements.

Prefer small, focused commits and descriptive PR titles.

If you want a specific project documented or demoed in more detail, open an issue and I will prioritize it.

ROADMAP

Planned additions include projects that explore API integration, global state patterns, performance optimization, and accessibility refinements.
